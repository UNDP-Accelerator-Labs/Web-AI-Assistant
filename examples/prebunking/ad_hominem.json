	"description": "Attacking a person making an argument, instead of addressing the argument itself. Ad hominem attacks are commonly used to redirect the listener away from the subject at hand and towards an individual.",
	"alt": [],
	"examples": [
		"During a political debate, one candidate claims no one should trust his opponent to lead a foreign policy because he failed a math class once.",
		"A headline calling attention to a candidate’s “screechy” voice during a rally instead of addressing the person’s arguments."
	],
	"explanation": "Ad hominem attacks are arguments that use emotional appeal rather than logic. They’re used with the explicit intent of redirecting the listener away from the topic at hand, which might be hard to poke holes in, and towards the “flaws” of an individual or entity, which might be easier.\nAd hominem attacks work because once an individual agrees that the holder of the point of view is flawed, it can become harder for them to agree that their point of view is not.",
	"actions": [
		"Be skeptical of arguments that question (or attack) the shortcomings of a person or entity, rather than the merits of their argument.",
		"Watch out for attempts at downplaying an argument due to the person’s/entity’s negative characteristics or limitations."
