	"examples": [
		"Jack: “Bob Dylan was the greatest songwriter.”\nJill: “No, Fleetwood Mac had the greatest live performers of all time”",
		"Why are you upset? Think of all the starving children around the world who have it worse than you."
	],
	"explanation": "When subtlety isn’t an option, a red herring may be employed to confuse the audience. By pivoting to an entirely unrelated, outrageous, and highly charged topic, a speaker can make the audience forget the original discussion.\nSome red herrings will subtly switch contexts, retaining superficial similarity between the new and original topic to minimize people’s ability to detect a context switch.",
	"actions": [
		"Be skeptical when someone responds to a controversial question by calling attention to another charged or polarized topic without actually answering the original question.",
		"Ask yourself: Does this answer the question? Red herrings are meant to distract from the original topic; it could be worth re-asking the question."
