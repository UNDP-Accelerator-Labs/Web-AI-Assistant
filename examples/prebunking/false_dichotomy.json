		"False dilemma",
		"Either-or-fallacy"
	],
	"examples": [
		"If you’re not with us, you’re against us.",
		"You’re either part of the solution or part of the problem.",
		"If you vote for X, you won't be able to pay your bills.",
		"Either you support the protests or you don’t believe in justice."
	],
	"explanation": "False dichotomy can be a persuasive technique because it artificially narrows choices, making people feel bad if they disagree with the supposedly right choice presented to them. In reality, there may not be clear right and wrong answers.\nFurthermore, those who employ false dilemmas will often position the intended/manipulative option as the more desirable of the two (or few) alternatives presented.",
	"actions": [
		"Watch out for “either/or,” “if this/then that” and other similar statements that imply one of two choices. Most situations are more complex than two outcomes.",
		"Keep an eye out for situations where the existence of other options is denied or concealed."
