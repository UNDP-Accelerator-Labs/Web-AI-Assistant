	"alt": [
		"Emotional manipulation",
		"Fearmongering (a subset of emotional language focused on frightening the listener)"
	],
	"examples": [
		"What you’re about to see will horrify you.",
		"You’ll be shocked by what your doctor is keeping from you.",
		"The judge issued a DISGUSTING ruling today. It will make your blood boil."
	],
	"explanation": "Research shows that using emotional words, especially ones that evoke negative emotions such as fear or outrage, increases the viral potential of digital content. Individuals are especially malleable and less focused on rational, deliberate decision making when pushed to a heightened emotional state.\nThe use of inflammatory language has proven to be especially effective when it comes to spreading ideas over social networks.",
	"actions": [
		"Take a moment to arrive at a well-thought-out conclusion or judgment —  especially before sharing or responding.",
		"Reflect on your emotional response to content online — if it makes you feel fearful, angry, or distressed, it may be because someone is trying to manipulate you to trigger a reaction."
