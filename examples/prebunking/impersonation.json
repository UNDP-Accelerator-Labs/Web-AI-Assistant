	"examples": [
		"Impersonation attacks include, but are not limited to, setting up fake social media accounts associated with a target, accessing a target’s online accounts to send messages, and spoofing the sender email address or phone number of a target to make it appear as if the target authored the message."

	"explanation": "Impersonating someone else can provide a range of gains to a malicious actor, from financial gains to reputational damage.",
	"actions": [
		"Strong digital security practices are a key first step to avoid being a target of impersonation. Two-factor authentication for account logins, strong password hygiene, and wariness of phishing or other social-engineering attacks can help prevent accounts from being compromised and allowing in impersonators.",
		"To avoid being manipulated by an impersonation (ie: where someone is pretending to be someone else) it is important to cross-check the source. Look to see if their current behavior matches their past behavior. Significant deviation can be a sign the account is an impersonation."
