	"description": "Asserting that a first step taken will inevitably lead to major, often disastrous, consequences.",
	"alt": [],
	"examples": [
		"If we implement even a modest change in policy, we’ll lose all of our freedoms.",
		"If you don’t pass tomorrow’s math test, then you can’t take calculus next year. If you don’t take calculus, you won’t get into college!"
	],
	"explanation": "Slippery slope arguments take advantage of the gray area between initial actions and their conclusions. They often rely on fear of grave – and unavoidable – consequences of any step taken and can bypass more critical evaluations of the arguments they present.",
	"actions": [
		"Consider the emotional aspect of the argument. If the predicted consequences are portrayed as dire or frightening, it's possible someone may be trying to manipulate you.",
		"Evaluate the likelihood that consequences would inevitably follow from a first step. Consider the other events that would have to take place and whether or not other outcomes might be possible."
