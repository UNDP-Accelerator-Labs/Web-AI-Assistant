According to recent reports, Morocco has lifted its international flight ban, which was previously in place for several months due to concerns over the Omicron COVID-19 variant. The ban was put in place in November 2021 and had been extended several times before being lifted.\n\nHowever, it appears that there have been some disruptions and cancellations of flights at Moroccan airports due to various reasons such as sandstorms, rain, and air traffic control issues. Additionally, there have been reports of airport closures and restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIt\'s worth noting that Morocco has recently reopened its borders to visitors and lifted its health restrictions, but there may be some specific restrictions or requirements for travel from certain countries. Specifically, Royal Air Maroc had canceled all scheduled flights to carry fans to Doha for the World Cup semi-final due to restrictions imposed by Qatari authorities.\n\nIt\'s also worth mentioning that Morocco has been taking measures to address air traffic control issues and improve airport infrastructure. The country is investing in its \"Airports 2030 Strategy\" which includes upgrading Marrakech and Agadir airports among other projects.\n\nOverall, it seems that the situation with blocking parts of airplanes in Morocco is being closely monitored by airlines and authorities, but the country has taken steps to reopen its borders and improve air travel infrastructure.'
