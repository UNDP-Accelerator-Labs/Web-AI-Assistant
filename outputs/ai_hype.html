<h1>The Market Hype Around AI</h1>

<p>AI has been a topic of interest for many years, but in recent times, it has gained significant attention and hype. But what is driving this market hype around AI?</p>

<p>According to a report by UCL Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose, "in the public interest" Mariana Mazzucato, Professor in the Economics of Innovation and Public Value, highlights the importance of AI in managing machine learning operations management, institutional support, and deployed models. (1)</p>

<h2>The Need for Explainable AI and Good Public Policy</h2>

<p>Another key aspect driving the market hype around AI is the need for explainable AI and good public policy. Machine learning algorithms need to be given a precisely specified objective, yet in the messy world of human decision-making and politics, it is often possible and even desirable to avoid spelling out conflicting aims. (2)</p>

<p>The World Bank's Access to Information Policy allows Bank-authored records to be made publicly available upon capture into the Bank's records management system when given a "public" security classification. This highlights the importance of data in AI and its potential applications in public sector projects. (3)</p>

<h2>Machine Learning Transforming Public Sector Services</h2>

<p>Machine learning is transforming public sector services by enabling predictive analytics, improving decision-making, optimizing operations like transportation and social services, and enhancing efficiency, while offering opportunities for innovation and improved resource allocation with careful planning. (4)</p>

<p>The market hype around AI can also be attributed to the growing demand for machine learning applications in daily life, such as commute estimation, smart email, banking/finance, evaluation & assessment, healthcare, social sites, and smart assistants. (5)</p>

<h2>Fairness and Trustworthiness in Machine Learning Systems</h2>

<p>Furthermore, the need for fairness and trustworthiness in machine learning systems has led to recent legislative initiatives and research in the ML community pointing out the need to document the data used in these systems. (6)</p>

<p>In addition, the role of corporations in AI research, development, and deployment is a major concern, as it can have profound consequences for society. The paper "Corporate Governance of Artificial Intelligence in the Public Interest" surveys opportunities to improve how corporations govern their AI activities to better advance the public interest. (7)</p>

<h2>The Potential of AI to Solve Public Interest Problems</h2>

<p>Finally, the potential of AI to solve public interest problems without losing its soul is an area of ongoing research and debate. The Data for Good Exchange (D4GX) is an annual conference centered on these novel problems and applications. (8)</p>

<h2>The Market Hype Around AI: A Combination of Factors</h2>

<p>In conclusion, the market hype around AI is driven by a combination of factors, including the need for explainable AI and good public policy, the importance of data in AI, the growing demand for machine learning applications in daily life, the need for fairness and trustworthiness in machine learning systems, the role of corporations in AI research and development, and the potential of AI to solve public interest problems.</p>

<p>In order to fully understand the market hype around AI, it is essential to consider the various factors that are driving this trend. These factors include technological advancements, increasing investment, growing awareness of AI's potential applications, and its impact on various industries.</p>

<p>As AI continues to evolve and improve, it is likely that the market hype around AI will continue to grow. However, it is also possible that the hype may eventually die down as the technology becomes more mainstream and widely adopted.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the market hype around AI is driven by a combination of technological advancements, increasing investment, growing awareness of its potential applications, and its impact on various industries. The rapid development and deployment of generative AI and large language model tools have started to transform industries and show the potential to touch many aspects of modern life.</p>
